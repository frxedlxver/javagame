The earth stirs as you exit. The world begins to twist, crack, and crumble around you.
The light is blinding. The crash is deafening. But soon it is quiet.
The cave has collapsed. Ahead is a path that appears to stretch on forever.
You collect your mind and take in your surroundings. 

The bayou. You've been here before, but it's different now.

The rot. The stench.

It's somehow _worse than the cave.
